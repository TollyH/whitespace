# Whitespace

Whitespace is an esoteric programming language that uses only 3 characters: spaces, tabs, and line feeds.

This is an interpreter written entirely in Python.

More information can be found [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language))

## Notes

Unlike other implementations of Whitespace, this version takes all input at the beginning before execution starts.

Numerical input is terminated by newlines (`\n`), but single-character input is not terminated, as only one character can be read at a time anyway.

For example, if you wanted to input the five characters in `Hello`, then the whole number `123`, the input would be as follows:
`Hello123\n`
